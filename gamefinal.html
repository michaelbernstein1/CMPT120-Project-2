	<h1>Text Adventure in Marist College</h1>
    <textarea class= "textarea" id="textarea" rows="25" cols= "60">

    Welcome to Marist College.

At Marist College, you will find wild red foxes, giant man-eating badgers, and angry security guards.

However, keep in mind that you can recieve a lot of good loot from places such as the Hancock, the cafeteria, and Dyson.

At the end of your journey, maybe you will get a business degree and end up a systems analyst that works 80 hours per week!

Or maybe you will suffer an even worse fate, and end up a sports communication major that works at Burger King! Explore campus and find out.</textarea>
